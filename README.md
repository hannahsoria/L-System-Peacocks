# L-System Peacocks

For this project I used L-systems and classes. I created an Lsystem class that reads an L-system string and replaces the base string with new rules given in text files and then builds a new string. This string is then drawn through a turtle interpreter class. The turtle interpreter class has specific instructions for when the string is drawn- based on what character is given. The function also creates instance variables. I created a scene using edited tree text files and files I wrote myself. This scene depicts various trees and three peacocks.
